# Lee-s-Blog
 The purpose of this website is to make multiple blog's that will be stored together showing the content, title, and author.

 Description
 On the Lees Blog page I made an interactive page with a form to enter information into that will log itself on a different page. The page you are sent to after hitting sumbit will have every blog you have sumitted filed and organized for you. Their is also a button to back out of the page with all your blogs and return to the first page to enter more info. You can also change the page from dark to light mode depending on which one you would rather have.
